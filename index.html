<p>There are a couple of things that make and motivate me to finish a project. First of all, I think about the fact that at the beginning of a project you may not like it, but in the process I can discover a lot of new things and often I like the project and I do it with more pleasure than at the beginning.  Secondly, my level as a designer depends on a well made projects , it is very important for me</p>

<p>Often I work with a computer sitting in bed, I feel more comfortable there:3 it is very important for me to be without unnecessary thoughts in my head and for this I turn on electronic music that will fill my mind and prevent unnecessary thoughts from entering my head while I work on projects ü§ôüèº</p>
